# towers_of_strength
Towers of Strength game for PyWeek 28

# Getting started
* Clone the repo
* (optional) Create a virtual environment, with Python 3.7
    * I usually name it '.env', which is already excluded with .gitignore, but feel free to use your own system. Just remember to update .gitignore if necessary
* Activate the virtual environment
* pip install - requirements.txt
* python main.py

# Status
* All functionality works

# Instructions
* Place supporters (red), food stations (yellow) and water stations (blue)
* When runners cross some coins, you will earn some extra money
* With lots of encouragement runners will speed up - but use more resources
* Get at least 15 runners over the finish line 
* There are currently 3 levels
* Once all levels are done, the game just crashes (to be completed)
